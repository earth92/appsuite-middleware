# The path prefix is used for additional configuration within CalDAV and CardDAV tests.
# The prefix differs with the Apache setup. If the Apache uses rewrite rules to forward requests
# to the MW, we don't need to take care of additional configuration. Therefore this property is 
# left *BLANK*. 
#
# However in some cases the Apache doesn't use rewrite rules or similar, e.g. see MW-1152. In that
# special cases you need to make sure to enter the path prefix of the registered servlets, e.g.
# with
#		com.openexchange.dav.prefixPath=/dav
#		com.openexchange.dav.proxyPrefixPath=/
# the path prefix should be 
#		pathPrefix=/dav
# Than CalDAV and CardDAV test should run again.
