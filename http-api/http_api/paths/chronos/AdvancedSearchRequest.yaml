        A JSON object describing the search term as introducted in [Advanced
        search](https://documentation.open-xchange.com/latest/middleware/http_api/5_advanced_search.html).
        Example:

        `{"filter":["and",["=",
        {"field":"summary"},"FooBar Meeting"],["=",{"field":"createdBy"},"1337"]]}`

        which represents 'summary = "FooBar Meeting" AND createdBy = "1337"'.
        Valid fields are the following ones specified in [Event
        data](#/definitions/EventData) model: `summary`, `location`, `description`, `organizer`, `attendees`, 
        `url`, `uid`, `timestamp`, `created`, `createdBy`, `lastModified`, `modifiedBy`, `sequence`, 
        `categories`, `color`, `rrule`, `transp`, `status`, `class`.
        Calendar users in `organizer` / `attendees` can either be matched by their internal entity identifier, 
        or based on their email address.
        The fields `startDate` and `endDate` can be defined with the `rangeStart` and `rangeEnd` URL parameters.
