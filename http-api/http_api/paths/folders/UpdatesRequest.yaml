          An array with data for new, modified and deleted folders. New and
          modified folders are represented

          by arrays. The elements of each array contain the information
          specified by the corresponding

          identifiers in the `columns` parameter. Deleted folders (should the
          ignore parameter be ever implemented)

          would be identified by their object IDs as plain strings, without
          being part of a nested array. In case

          of errors the responsible fields in the response are filled (see
          [Error handling](#error-handling)).
