feature_name: Grizzly
feature_description: |
  This page shows the properties for the grizzly server contained in the package
  open-xchange-grizzly. In your OX setup grizzly is located behind the
  load-balancer and accepts incoming client requests. Communication with the
  load balancer is done via http, e.g via Apache's mod_proxy_http.

  For more informations see [[https://documentation.open-xchange.com/{{version}}/middleware/components/grizzly.html]].
properties:
    - key: com.openexchange.http.grizzly.wsTimeoutMillis
      description: |
        Specifies the Web Socket timeout in milliseconds
      defaultValue: 900000
      version: 7.8.3
      reloadable: false
      configcascadeAware: false
      related: com.openexchange.websockets.enabled
      file: grizzly.properties
      packageName: open-xchange-grizzly
      tags: ["Grizzly","Websockets", "Timeout"]
    - key: com.openexchange.http.grizzly.sessionExpiryCheckInterval
      description: |
        Specifies the interval in seconds when to check for expired/invalid HTTP sessions
        This value should be aligned to property [[com.openexchange.servlet.maxInactiveInterval]]
        that defines how long (in seconds) a HTTP session may stay idle/inactive until considered
        as invalid.
      defaultValue: 60
      version: 7.8.4
      reloadable: false
      configcascadeAware: false
      related: com.openexchange.servlet.maxInactiveInterval
      file: grizzly.properties
      packageName: open-xchange-grizzly
      tags: ["Grizzly","Session"]
    - key: com.openexchange.http.grizzly.maxNumberOfConcurrentRequests
      description: |
        Specifies the number of concurrent HTTP requests that are allowed being processed.
        Those requests exceeding that limit will encounter a 503 "The server is temporary overloaded..." status code and accompanying error page
        A value of less than or equal to <code>0</code> (zero) effectively disables that limitation.
        The chosen value for this property should be aligned to the configured "ulimit" of the backing operating system. E.g. having "ulimit" set
        to 8,192 (given that JVM is the only main process running for OS user) implies that ~6,000 should be considered for this property leaving
        some room for threads not associated with an HTTP request.

    - key: com.openexchange.http.grizzly.readTimeoutMillis

    - key: com.openexchange.http.grizzly.hasCometEnabled
      description: |
        Comet is an umbrella term used to describe a technique allowing web browser to
        receive almost real time updates from the server. The two most common
        approaches are long polling and streaming. Long polling differs from streaming
        in that each update from the server ultimately results in another follow up
        request from the client.

    - key: com.openexchange.http.grizzly.sessionUnjoinedThreshold
      description: |
        Specifies the threshold in seconds when a new (see paragraph below) HTTP session is considered as subject for being removed since
        unjoined for a sufficient time range.
        
        An HTTP session is considered as new (or unjoined) if the client does not yet know about the session or if the client chooses not
        to join the session. For example, if the server used only cookie-based sessions, and the client had disabled the use of cookies,
        then a session would be new on each request.
        
        A value of equal to or less than 0 (zero) disables this check; meaning HTTP sessions are not removed based on new/unjoined status
        during clean-up run.
