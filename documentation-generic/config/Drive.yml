    - key: com.openexchange.capability.drive
      description: |
        Enables or disables the "drive" module capability globally. The capability
        can also be set more fine-grained via config cascade. Per default it is only
        enabled for users that have the "infostore" permission set. This is configured
        in /opt/open-xchange/etc/contextSets/drive.yml.

    - key: com.openexchange.drive.useTempFolder
      description: |
        Specifies whether the synchronization logic will make use of a folder named
        ".drive" below the root synchronization folder or not. If enabled, this
        folder is used to store temporary uploads and removed files, which usually
        leads to a better user experience since previously synchronized files can
        be restored from there for example. If not, removed files are not kept, and
        uploads are performed directly in the target folder.

      description: |
        Configures the interval between runs of the cleaner process for the
        temporary ".drive" folder. A cleaner run is only initiated if the
        synchronization is idle, i.e. the last synchronization resulted in no
        actions to be performed, and the last run was before the configured
        interval. The value can be defined using units of measurement: "D" (=days),
        "W" (=weeks) and "H" (=hours).

        Defines the maximum age of files and directories to be kept inside the
        temporary ".drive" folder. Files or directories that were last modified
        before the configured age are deleted during the next run of the cleaner
        process. The value can be defined using units of measurement: "D" (=days),
        "W" (=weeks) and "H" (=hours).

      description: |
        Defines the interval of a periodic background task that performs cleanup 
        operations for cached checksums in the database. The task is executed only 
        once per interval in the cluster, so this value should be equally defined 
        on each node.
        The value can be defined using units of measurement: "D" (=days), 
        "W" (=weeks) and "H" (=hours) with a minimum of "1H" (one hour). 
        A value of "0" disables the periodic background task.

      description: |
        Allows to limit the maximum used bandwidth for all downloads. If
        configured, downloads via the drive module handled by this backend node will
        not exceed the configured bandwidth. The available bandwidth is defined as
        the number of allowed bytes per second, where the byte value can be
        specified with one of the units "B" (bytes), "kB" (kilobyte), "MB"
        (Megabyte) or "GB" (Gigabyte), e.g. "10 MB". Must fit into the "Integer"

        Specifies the maximum allowed number of synchronization operations, i.e.
        all requests to the "drive" module apart from up- and downloads, that the
        server accepts concurrently. While the limit is reached, further
        synchronization requests are rejected in a HTTP 503 manner (service

      description: |
        Allows to exclude specific root folders from OX Drive synchronization explicitly. 
        Excluded folders may not be used as root folder for the synchronization, 
        however, this does not apply to their subfolders automatically. 
        This also means that a subfolder defined here will still be synchronized to clients, if 
        their parent root synchronization folder isn't.
        Excluded folders should be specified in a comma-separated list of their unique identifiers.
        Typical candidates for the blacklist would be folder 15 (the "public folders" root) 
        or folder 10 (the "shared folders" root) in large enterprise installations.

        The mobile clients maximum file length of uploads to be stored directly at the target location - others are going to be written to a
        temporary upload file first.

      description: |
        The default timeout in milliseconds to use for the long polling "listen" operation, if not overridden by clients. Defaults to 90000, and 
        should be adjusted if there are event lowever timeouts in upfront proxies.

    - key: com.openexchange.drive.lazyDirectoryChecksumCalculation
      description: |
        Configures whether directory checksums should be calculated in a lazy way or not. If enabled, server directory checksums will be 
        retrieved in chunks according to the configured "maxDirectoryActions", which may reduce the processing time for the initial sync of 
        large directory subtrees.

    - key: com.openexchange.drive.maxSyncProcessingTime
      description: |
        Configures the processing time (in seconds) after a running syncFiles- or syncFolders-operation is cancelled. This can be helpful 
        during initial synchronizations where no previously calculated checksums are available, and a long running request would otherwise be
        interrupted by a proxy timeout. The value can be defined using units of measurement: "m" (=minutes), "s" (=seconds) and "ms" 
        (=milliseconds).
      defaultValue: 90s
